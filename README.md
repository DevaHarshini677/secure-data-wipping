# 🛡️ SecureWiper: Enterprise Data Sanitization Lab

**SecureWiper** is a high-fidelity data erasure simulator and forensic certificate generator designed for security auditors and IT professionals. It simulates military-grade sanitization processes compliant with **NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1** standards.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Forensic Sanitization Simulator**: Visualize bit-level randomization and overwrite cycles (up to 35 passes).
- **Gemini AI Audit Engine**: Automatically generates professional security summaries and forensic notes based on asset metadata.
- **High-Fidelity PDF Generation**: Produces print-ready, A4-optimized certificates with decorative borders and security watermarks.
- **JSON-to-PDF Converter**: Import existing SWC (SecureWiper Certificate) JSON logs to reconstruct high-fidelity documents instantly.
- **Custom Digital Signatures**: Upload and embed authorized signatures directly into the certification audit trail.
- **NIST Compliance**: Built to follow strict data destruction protocols, including SHA-256 pre/post hashing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Optimized for A4 printing)
- **Intelligence**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-3-flash-preview`)
- **Graphics**: Lucide-React Icons & SVG Signature Engine
- **Verification**: QR Code (SVG) for instant certificate validation

## 📄 Certificate Format
Certificates generated by SecureWiper include:
- **Unique ID**: Auto-generated forensic tracking number.
- **Hash Audit**: SHA-256 pre-wipe and post-wipe checksums.
- **Compliance Notes**: AI-generated verification summaries.
- **Validation**: Scannable QR code for cloud verification.

## 🔒 Security Policy
This tool is a simulator and generator. While it simulates the compute cycles required for randomization, it is designed for **documentation and audit preparation**. For physical hardware destruction, always use verified hardware-level sanitization tools in conjunction with SecureWiper's certification engine.
